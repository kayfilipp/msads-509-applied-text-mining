Better Do It Right



Mama told me, boy, you best behave
'Cause Santa keeps a list of all his faves
And if you don't shape up, you ain't gettin' squat
But the devil on my shoulder's gettin' hot

Hotter than heaven, cool outta sight
If I'm gonna do wrong
I'm gonna do it right

So he took me for a ride in his Cadillac
Stolen from a kleptomaniac at a horse race track
I said, sir, it's Christmas Eve, I should be home in bed
Instead, he said, you merry gentle men always bet on red

The duke of deception, malice and spite
If I'm gonna do wrong
I'm gonna do it right

When you're done, you're really done
We look back and say, hey, that was fun
When all you wanted was a BB gun
Santa Claus never did come

When you're done, you're really done
We look back and say, hey, that was fun

So he took me for a ride in his big ol' sleigh
We flew around the world in just one day, Johnny Mathis sang
I said, sir, what you got for me in that sled?
Instead, he said, boy, you been bettin' on a darker shade of red

Hotter than heaven, cool outta sight
Duke of deception, malice and spite

Johnny is singin', (Johnny is singin') remember tonight
If you gotta do wrong, you better do it right
