Burn Cycle



You must admit that
You look like shit 'cuz
You've been awake all week
Sometimes this space that
You call your place gets
Up to it ceiling deep

[BRIDGE:]
You can come down...
You can come down to me
You can come down...
You can come down to me

You tell us no way
We can't see what you say
We see it with our own eyes
You're in it so deep
That you can't even sleep
Without handing a stack of lies

You've been in a craze
For so many days
You can't even crack a grin

So how can you stand there
And tell us that you care
While you're doing yourself in?

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS:]
You're spinning your wheels
You're looking for thrills
You're burning your bridges down
Make no mistakes
And take some complaints
To turn the cycle around

You had us tricked we
Thought you had it kicked
You're back on the horse again
So why should it be that
We have to see
You doing yourself in?

[BRIDGE]

(ahhhh)
Burnin' your bridges down!
(ahhhh)
Turn the cycle

[CHORUS]
