Christmas Ain't Christmas



Christmas just ain't Christmas without the ones you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's without the ones you love

Underneath the mistletoe, I saw a face all a glow
Last year this time
An' now I stand all alone and my house is not a home
Without that girl of mine, oh

Christmas just ain't Christmas without the ones you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's without the ones you love

12 o'clock and all is well and I was doing, oh so swell
Last year this time
Going shoppin' for presents together
Would make it last to leave each other, but never
It was a waste of time, oh

Christmas just ain't Christmas without the ones you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's without the ones you love

Christmas just ain't Christmas without the one you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's without the one you love

Christmas just ain't Christmas without the ones you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's without the one you love

Christmas just ain't Christmas without the one you love
New Year's just ain't New Year's without the one you love
