Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)



(Christmas)
The snow's comin' down
(Christmas)
I'm watchin' it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home

(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
Are ringin' a song
(Christmas)
What a happy sound
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home

They're singin', 'Deck the Halls'
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas)
I'm watchin' 'em shine
(Christmas)
You should be here with me
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home

They're singin', 'Deck the Halls'
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas)
If there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back these tears
(Christmas)
Wow, it's Christmas day
(Christmas)

Please, please
(Christmas)
Please, please, please, please
Please, come home

(Christmas)
Please come home
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home
(Christmas)
Baby, please come home
(Christmas)

Ooh, ooh, please come home
(Christmas)
Please come home
(Christmas)
Ooh, please come home
(Christmas)

I'll meet you here,baby
You know I love you
(Christmas)
Come home, baby, come home, baby

(Christmas)
Ooh yes, please come home
(Christmas)
Ooh yeah, please come home
(Christmas)
Hey, baby, please come home
(Christmas)

(Christmas)
Please come home
(Christmas)
Oh, baby, please come home
(Christmas, Christmas)
