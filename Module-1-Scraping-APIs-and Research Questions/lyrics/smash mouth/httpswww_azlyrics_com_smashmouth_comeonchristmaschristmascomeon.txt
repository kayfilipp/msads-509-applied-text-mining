Come On Christmas, Christmas Come On



Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on
Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on

Every year I wait for Christmas to come, it's all right
(It's all right, it's all right, it's all right)
A lot of presents, I'll be opening one, it's all right
(It's all right, it's all right, it's all right)

If I get nothing it'll be okay
'Cause Santa promised you won't go away

Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on
Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on

When we're together all the jingle bells ring, it's all right
(It's all right, it's all right, it's all right)
My Christmas baby really makes my heart sing, it's all right
(It's all right, it's all right, it's all right)

You know I know you're coming home to stay
It's Christmas morning every single day

Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on
Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on

Hey
Hey baby

If I get nothing it'll be okay
'Cause Santa promised you won't go away

Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on
Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on

Come on, Christmas
Christmas, come on
Come on, Christmas
Christmas come
Christmas come
Christmas, come on
