Don't Believe In Christmas



Well mom and dad said I could
So I did what I should
I hung my stocking on a wall
I didn't get a thing at all

I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year

Well stayin' up late at night
To see Santa Claus fly
Well sure enough don't ya know
The fat boy didn't show

I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year

Well I tried to get a little kiss
From a pretty little miss
She slapped me down and said, "You jerk
Mistletoe doesn't work"

I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year
All right!

Well wakin' up the reindeer
To make a little kids cheer
The reason that his nose shine
Santa gave him moonshine

I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year

Ah decorate the street lights
People lookin' to get right
One hand will slap ya back
The other one will take ya jack

I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
I don't believe in Christmas
'Cause I didn't get nothin' last year
All right!
