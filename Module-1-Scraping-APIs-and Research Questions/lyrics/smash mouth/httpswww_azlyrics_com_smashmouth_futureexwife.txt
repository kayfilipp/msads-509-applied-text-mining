Future Ex Wife



I could be the one,
Will we ever know
I'm buying you a ring
And that's just how I roll
I think we've got a shot
I'll treat you really nice
So tell me do you wanna,
Do you wanna be?

I need to have and hold
That's just the way I am
I do it all the time,
I do the best I can
And if we fall apart,
I'll still be in your life
So tell me do you wanna be

My future ex wife,
Let me take you home
Can't you see that I
Don't wanna be alone
And keep me up all night,
Never let me go
Turn off all the lights,
I don't wanna fight
With my future ex wife,
Yeah my future ex wife

And if we had a kid,
I'd give you all my money
The check is in the mail
And I'll still call you honey
There'll be no regret,
I promise that's no lie
So tell me do you wanna be

My future ex wife,
Let me take you home
Can't you see that I
Don't wanna be alone
And keep me up all night,
Never let me go
Turn off all the lights,
I don't wanna fight
With my future ex wife,
Yeah my future ex wife

What is it that you just don't understand
And I can't imagine you with another man
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa oh

My future ex wife,
Let me take you home
Can't you see that I
Don't wanna be alone
And keep me up all night,
Never let me go
Turn off all the lights,
I don't wanna fight
With my future ex wife,
Let me take you home
Can't you see that I
Don't wanna be alone
And keep me up all night,
Never let me go
Turn off all the lights,
I don't wanna fight
With my future ex wife,
Yeah my future ex wife
My future ex wife
