Get The Picture?



Go, go away 
Far, far away 
Be on your way

Please leave me be, let me be me once again 
Outta sight, outta mind, and I'm going outta mine 
And my heart, and my head may be black but we ain't quite dead yet 

I'm hangin up now, so there ain't no use in you hangin' round 
I'm hangin up now, you get the picture 

There was a day, when I, I could say anything 
But you came to judge, you held a grudge all the way 
And my time was all mine, anytime and now its mine o mine 

And I'm hangin up now, so there ain't no use in you hangin' round 
I'm hangin up now, you better get the picture 

I gotta hand to you though
You took me under
I guess youâll never really now
Until its over
I was happy going mad girl
I thought you were mine but I was had
It's such a dirty world

Go, go away
Far, far away
Be on your way

Please leave me be, let me be me once again 
Outta sight (outta sight), outta mind (outta mind) 
And I'm going outta mine 

So I'm hangin up now
There ain't any use in you hangin' round
I'm hangin up now,
So donât let me catch you hangin' round
I'm hanging up now
I'm hanging up now
I'm hanging up now
Youâll get the picture
