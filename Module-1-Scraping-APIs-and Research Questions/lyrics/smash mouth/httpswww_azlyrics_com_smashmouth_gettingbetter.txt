Getting Better



It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school
(No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
(No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down, turnin' around
Feeling me up with your rules

I've got to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
I have to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
A little better since you've been mine

I used to be an angry young man
Be hiding my head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can, yeah

I've got to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
I have to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
(It's getting better all the time)
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

I, I have to admit it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
You're stressed, I admit it's getting better
(Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
