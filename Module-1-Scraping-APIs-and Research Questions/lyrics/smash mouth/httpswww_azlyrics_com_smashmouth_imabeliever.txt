I'm A Believer



I thought love was
Only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else
But not for me

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seems
Disappointment haunted
All my dreams

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

I thought love was more or less a given thing
But the more I gave the less I got, oh yeah

What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
And not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind

Now I'm a believer
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'm a believer
Then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm a believer
Now I'm a believer
