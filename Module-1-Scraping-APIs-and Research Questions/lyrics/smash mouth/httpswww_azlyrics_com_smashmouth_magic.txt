Magic



When I met her she was waiting on a plane 
At the airport restaurant I said what's your name 
She said I grew up in Chicago 
I'm on my way up to Toronto 
Maybe you could come and stay a couple days 

You can't explain the things she does 
It's like we're already breaking up 
First you see her but then you don't 
And you ask yourself where'd hell she go 
And she'll tell you that she's so in love 
Makes you think that she's the one 
Disappears right before your eyes 
And you realize it's like magic 
Just like magic 

She told me she would call me in a week 
But I'm still waiting on the phone to ring 
Now she's acting like Houdini 
Yeah she had me make believing 
She gets just what she wants and then she leaves 

You can't explain the things she does 
It's like we're already breaking up 
First you see her but then you don't 
And you ask yourself where'd hell she go 
And she'll tell you that she's so in love 
Makes you think that she's the one 
Disappears right before your eyes 
And you realize it's like magic 
Just like magic 

I thought she was the one one one 
An inexplicable feeling but just as soon as she deal it 
She was done done done 
She sold me a broken promise and I just wanna be honest tonight 
Cuz I wasn't lookin' for the lead on 
I guess that she was lookin' for another heart to feed on 
Uh, she told me she wanted me to cop a feel 
And then she pulled a David Copperfield 
And she gone
