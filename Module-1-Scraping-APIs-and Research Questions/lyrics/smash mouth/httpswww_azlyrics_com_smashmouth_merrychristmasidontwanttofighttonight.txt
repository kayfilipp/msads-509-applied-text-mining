Merry Christmas
I don't want
To fight tonight
Merry Christmas
I don't want
To fight tonight
Merry Christmas
I don't want
To fight tonight
With you

Where is Santa?
At his sleigh?
Tell me why
Is it always this way?
Where is Rudolph?
Where is Blitzen, baby?
Merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry
Christmas

All the children
Are tucked in their beds
Sugar-plum fairies
Dancing in their heads
Snowball fighting
It's so exciting, baby

I love you
And you love me
And that's the way
It's got to be
I loved you
From the start
'Cause Christmas
Ain't the time
For breaking
Each other's hearts
