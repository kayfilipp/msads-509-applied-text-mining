She's Into Me



[Verse:]
I canât help look in her direction,
Sheâs got all of my attention.
The way she says hello,
She can make it a perfect day.

She knows all the boys are talking,
About the way, the way that she is rocking
Those jeans and a t-shirt,
But she donât look their way.

[Pre-chorus:]
She is everything and more
That this boy is looking for

[Chorus:]
âCause sheâs got eyes that are brighter than the summer sky,
And a smile that could stop a war.
No surprise seeing heads turn when she walks by,
âKind of beauty that you canât ignore.

When she laughs all the worry in the world is gone,
Sheâs truly in a different league.
Sheâs amazing, and sheâs into me.
(Doo doo)

[Verse:]
Lips like sugar-coated gumdrops,
Code red, I think she made my heart stop.
Iâm gonna tell her I love her
As soon as I can catch my breath.

[Pre-chorus:]
There ainât no way I donât deserve, no, no,
Someone as wonderful as her.

[Chorus:]
âCause sheâs got eyes that are brighter than the summer sky,
And a smile that could stop a war.
No surprise seeing heads turn when she walks by,
âKind of beauty that you canât ignore.

When she laughs all the worry in the world is gone,
Sheâs truly in a different league.
Sheâs amazing, and sheâs into me.
(Oh yeah)

[Bridge:]
And every time Iâm with her all I want the world to know is that sheâs my girl.
Just like a hit record topping every one of the chart.
âCause I just wanna wrap my arms around her.
I swear Iâll never let her go.

[Chorus:]
âCause sheâs got eyes that are brighter than the summer sky,
And a smile that could stop a war.
No surprise seeing heads turn when she walks by,
âKind of beauty that you canât ignore.

When she laughs all the worry in the world is gone,
Sheâs truly in a different league.
Sheâs amazing, oh sheâs amazing,
Yeah sheâs amazing, and sheâs into me.
(Doo doo)
