The Christmas Song



All the lights are coming on, now
How I wish that it would snow, now
I don't fell like goin' home, now
I wish that I could stay

All the trees are on display, now
And it's cold, now
I don't feel like going home, now
I wish that I could stay

I wish that I could walk
I wish that I could walk
I wish that I could walk
You home

All the lights are coming on, now
How I wish that it would snow, now
I don't fell like goin' home, now
I wish that I could stay

Santa's comin' to town
With sequins in his hair
Santa's comin' to town
With sequins in his hair

I wish that I could walk
I wish that I could walk
I wish that I could walk
You home
