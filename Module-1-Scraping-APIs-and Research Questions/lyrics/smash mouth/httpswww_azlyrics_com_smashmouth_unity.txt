Unity



U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
We gotta come together if we're gonna get it done
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
We gotta come together if we're gonna get it done

I'm here to clear the swamp, we've been misled
And if you think it's a joke you're gonna end up dead
The evil man plans to divide us
But we must all stand side by side
The force is with us, it will get better
Of course we'll win it if we stick together
One for all, and all for one
But we gotta come together if we're gonna get it done

The world don't stop, one-way track
History repeats, don't look back
There's just one way we survive
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
Every day takes its toll
We're spinnin' round and round, lost control
The only way we survive
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y

Why does it come to two million dollar homes?
Blowing up in fire and flames, bad karma
People should be equal, the same, the rich and the poor
Politically walkin' the same lane, no changin' this thing
The evil, wicked, evil, suffering pain with daily strain
It's like a blistered hand from guitar strings
Multi-millions got him high, acting strange
Understand my unity slang, young [?] when the world hear it

Make a nation look in the mirror while your wife [?]
Be preparing to shock [?]
To separate [?] won't scare us
It's time for no flare-ups
Strong communication pair-up
Firefighters comin' up to watch [?] burn with the buck
Not knowin' I'm your brother to trust
Put you on a drug for safety
Your family need to believe in us
The red cross who cross over double-crosses
I'ma save you like Jesus

The world don't stop, one-way track
History repeats, don't look back
There's just one way we survive
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
Every day takes its toll
We're spinnin' round and round, lost control
The only way we survive
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y

Democracy, hypocrisy
Idiocracy, false prophecy
You and me we need unity
Then and only then can we all be free

U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
We gotta come together if we're gonna get it done
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
We gotta come together if we're gonna get it done
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
We gotta come together if we're gonna get it done
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
We gotta come together, then we'll all be one

The world don't stop, one-way track
History repeats, don't look back
There's just one way we survive
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
Every day takes its toll
We're spinnin' round and round, lost control
The only way we survive
U-N-I, U-N-I, T-Y
