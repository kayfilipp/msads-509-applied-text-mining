Walkin' On The Sun (Dave Aude Club Remix)



The sun
The sun
The sun
Walkin' on the sun
The sun
The sun
The sun

It ain't no joke
I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world
To sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world
To snuff the fires and the liars
Hey, I know it's just a song
But it's spice for the recipe

This is a love attack
I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad
It retracts before impact
And just like fashion it's a passion
For the with-it and hip
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

So don't delay, act now
Supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow there may
Be a tomorrow, but if
The offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

Walkin' on the sun
The sun

Twenty-five years ago
They spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression
And together they toked
And they folked out with guitars
Around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin'
Man, what the hell happened

Then some were spellbound
Some were hellbound, some they fell down
And some got back up
And fought back 'gainst the melt down
And their kids were hippie chicks
All hypocrites
Because fashion is smashin'
The true meaning of it

So don't delay, act now
Supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow there may
Be a tomorrow, but if
The offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

Walkin' on the sun
The sun

It ain't no joke
When a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears
Because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up
So choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't reform
No godlike hocus-pocus

So don't sit back, kick back
And watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood
Is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack
Puts you away
You need to be there
When your baby's old enough to relate

So don't delay, act now
Supplies are running out
Allow if you're still alive
Six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow there may
Be a tomorrow, but if
The offer's shunned
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun
You might as well be walkin' on the sun

The sun
The sun
The sun
Walkin' on the sun
The sun
The sun
The sun
Walkin' on the sun
The sun
The sun
The sun
