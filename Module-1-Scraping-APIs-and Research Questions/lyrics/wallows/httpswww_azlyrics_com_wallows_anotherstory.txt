Another Story



[Braeden:]
I can hear my name on your lips
And I won't forget the last time we kissed
Though we aren't together I feel your grin
And I'm not ashamed of what I missed
I know I use the word "forever"
I promise I think we'll be better
If we don't let months turn to years
But we'll always know what kept us here

We're another story
Can name my every word you ever told me
We know that every ending
Opens a door to a new beginning
