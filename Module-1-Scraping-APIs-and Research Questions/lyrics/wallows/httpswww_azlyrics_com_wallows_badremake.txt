Bad Remake



To-Today's the day
You will finally get your big break
As you scream through the tears
The months turn to years
What's left of you here?

I feel as though, I feel as though
You should know, you should know

Oh, fame is a grave
Can't breathe, but hope you're well paid
There's things that you wish you could change
Some films just should not be remade

Left, left wanting more
Praise the soundtrack, but hate the score
The worst CGI I've seen in a while
They scream from the aisle

Act like you know, I've told you so
What's it like down below?

Oh, fame is a grave
Can't breathe, but hope you're well paid
There's things that you wish you could change
Some films just should not be remade

Get carried away
Across center stage
You're a constellation
And I'm empty space

Oh, fame is your grave
Can't breathe, but I hope you're well made
There's things that you wish you could change
Some films just should not be remade
