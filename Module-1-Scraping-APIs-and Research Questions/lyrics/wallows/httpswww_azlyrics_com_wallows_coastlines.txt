Coastlines



Can you hear them knocking at our door?
Can't let them take us away no more
Can you hear them knocking at our door?
Same excuses that we've heard before
Stare at pictures of you 'til I'm blind
Do your words make up what's on your mind?
Can you hear them knocking at our door?

I don't wanna think about it
If I'm the only thing on your mind
I don't wanna think about it
If I'm really wastin' all of your time
I don't wanna think about it
When we're on different coastlines
I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna think about it

I don't wanna think about it
I don't mean to be dramatic
I don't wanna think about it
'Bout it

Shut the door and we can lock them out
Things look different when you're not around
Too embarrassed to admit I've cried
Sort of hope it's that way on your side

I don't wanna think about it
If I'm the only thing on your mind
I don't wanna think about it
If I'm really wastin' all of your time
I don't wanna think about it
When we're on different coastlines
I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna think about it

We can hear them knocking at our door
Won't let them take us away no more
Can you hear them knocking at our door?
Can you hear them knocking at our door?

I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna think about it
I don't mean to be dramatic
I don't wanna think about it
'Bout it
I don't wanna think about it
I don't wanna think about it
I don't mean to be dramatic
I don't wanna think about it
'Bout it
