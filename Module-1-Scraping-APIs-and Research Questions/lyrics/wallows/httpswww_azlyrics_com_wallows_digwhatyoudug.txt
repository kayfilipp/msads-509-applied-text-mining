Dig What You Dug



You never wanted all the friends you've got
Turned into someone that you know you're not
Pick up something for yourself that you like
Before you get out and get what's on their mind, like

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me what I already know
I don't, I don't, I don't get it, could you remind me so
I don't make a fool out of me, I do not trust myself
I can smile, but I won't speak and I can listen well

I love the way you say my name
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again

Wondering what they're gonna give a shrug
You're scared that you're gonna dig what they dug, so

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me what, I already know
I don't, I don't, I don't get it, could you remind me though?

I love the way you say my name
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again (I like to listen to you speak)
Say it again (Especially when it's to me)

You never wanted all the friends you've got
(You never wanted all the)
You never wanted all the friends you've got
(You never wanted all the)
You never wanted all the friends you've got
And that's okay 'cause they're still finding a God

Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again

I dig what you dug, and I dug what you dig
