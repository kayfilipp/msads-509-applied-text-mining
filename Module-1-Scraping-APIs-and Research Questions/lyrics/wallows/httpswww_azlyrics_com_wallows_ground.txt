Ground



Inverted narcissist
Check something off my list
For now we're stuck at home
Throw out your telephone
Run with the wolves at night
Straight outta "boys don't cry"
Crash it and speed away
Scream at the games we've play

Speak out in a different language
Don't mind, I can't take my eyes off it
We were running to grow up every weekend
Now we're watching the moments as they're leaving

Losing the feeling now
Laugh when I hit the ground
Hands touching in the dark
Symmetry isnât art

I don't ever wanna go
Living in a memory, nothing to show
But I can't let it get away
Hanging out the window, nothing to say

Speak out in a different language
Don't mind, I can't take my eyes off it
We were running to grow up every weekend
Now we're watching the moments as they're leaving

Don't let them take away all the games we've played
Go on and take a bow, 'cause it's over now

Speak out in a different language
Don't try, I can't take my mind off it
We were running to grow up every weekend
Now we're watching the moments as they're leaving
