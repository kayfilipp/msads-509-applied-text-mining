Hard To Believe



I know the summer won't change
All the fires that start can't be saved
Does that apply to you and me too?
There's some things I've been meaning to say to you

Like I just want to breathe, is that so hard to believe?

What age would you call your prime?
We've been at this for a long time
That's a point that I think I could use
I can't make up another drawn out, vague excuse
I'm trying hard not to lie
Things I'm keeping close on both sides
But is my silence deafening you?
It keeps me up at night, I just need a few

And I just want to breathe, is that so hard to believe?

Or would you agree with me?
And who would you choose to be?
I think that we'll have to see before too long now

Got you checking in again
I've got a friend I've been talking to
And if you knew I've fallen out
You're checking in again
I've got a friend I've been talking to
And if you knew I've fallen

And I hope you're happy with the the things that you've got
And I'll still remember all the bright parking lots
And I can finally breathe, is it so hard to believe it now?
Was I tough to be around?
Well, maybe you're better now
All because I let you down
I know there's so much I didn't say
I don't want to be that way
I guess that's a price you pay
For giving your trust away
I'm giving mine now
