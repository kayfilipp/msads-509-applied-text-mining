Hurts Me



Haven't talked in months
I knew it'd be tough
Forward to April
Did I give it enough?
What to blame it on now?
I know myself better than you do
Part of me is something that you'll never see
We made a pact
(Now we'll never get it back)

I won't lie
(But it really doesn't matter)
I don't need it
(I'm obsessed when I don't have it)
It's alright
(What I want and what I don't)
Can you see that?
(But I never want to know)
I won't lie
(I'm always running away)
I don't need it
(So I really can't complain)
I don't mind
(I'll have to accept that I)
I don't need it 'cause it hurts me

Losing control
I start to fold
Karma for heartbreak is really taking it's toll
Hope that you're doing alright
You know yourself better than I do
Part of you is always there with someone new
But it's just for fun
Over 'fore it has begun

I won't lie
(But it really doesn't matter)
I don't need it
(I'm obsessed when I don't have it)
It's alright
(What I want and what I don't)
Can you see that?
(But I never want to know)
I won't lie
(I'm always running away)
I don't need it
(So I really can't complain)
I don't mind
(I'll have to accept that I)
I don't need it 'cause it hurts me

Better to break than bend again
Heal up the wounds that did you in
Hurt by the thought that you'd give in
But who do I hurt for?
(Now I'll never get it back)

I won't lie
(But it really doesn't matter)
I don't need it
(I'm obsessed when I don't have it)
It's alright
(What I want and what I don't)
Can you see that?
(But I never want to know)
I won't lie
(I'm always running away)
I don't need it
(So I really can't complain)
I don't mind
(I'll have to accept that I)
I don't need it 'cause it hurts me

I don't need it 'cause it hurts me
I don't need it 'cause it hurts me
I don't need it 'cause it hurts me
I don't need it
