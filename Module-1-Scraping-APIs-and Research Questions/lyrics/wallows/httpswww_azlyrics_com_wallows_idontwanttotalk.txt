I Don't Want To Talk



If I reflect, look back on that other place and time
When you left for a while and I kind of lost my mind

Realized the older I get, I get more insecure
If I don't have you by my side, then I can't be sure

I'm not alright, but I don't need comfort
I don't want to talk
So could you tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over now?
Then I could shut this off
(Woo)

I went to send you off, felt off by what I saw there
Him in the leopard pattern coat that you wished you'd share
You in your brand new sweatsuit and your fresh platinum hair
Your FjÃ¤llrÃ¤ven KÃ¥nken's packed and I watch him stare

I'm not alright, but I don't need comfort
I don't want to talk
So could you tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over now?
Then I could shut this off

Feeling like my mind's wiped
He looks more like your type
If I leave you tonight, will he leave your eyes wide?
Bet he didn't think first when he did a crowd surf
Effortlessly expert
Attention grabber

Don't usually cry, but looks like that's over
I start to lose sight of myself and I wish I could shut it
Wish I could shut it off

No, I'm not alright, but I don't need comfort
I don't want to talk
So could you tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over now?
Then I could shut this off
(Woo)
