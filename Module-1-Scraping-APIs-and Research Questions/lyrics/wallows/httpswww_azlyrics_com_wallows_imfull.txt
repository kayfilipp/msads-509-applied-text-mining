I'm Full



Hit me once again
Then I'm screaming at my friends
'Cause I'm at it again
Tell me something, tell me what you like
Don't remind me there's no one in sight, though
You're my only friend
You're at it again

Then I'm screamin' in my head when I've got nowhere to go
Then I'm fallin' into bed, on a high can it go low
And I know I'm bound to lose
When I feel the need to use
Why I'm full

Had it once, never tried
Is it true or is it a lie?
You're at it again
Every time I put my hands somewhere
There's always Reece's there
I'm at it again
Along with a friend

Then I'm screamin' in my head when I've got nowhere to go
Then I'm fallin' into bed, on a high can it go low
And I know I'm bound to lose
When I feel the need to use
Why I'm full

So
Who's it gonna be?
You or me
When we're gone
If you get to know
Me at all
Will you run?
I can't even think anymore
And I'm tired of the disadvantage
Holdin' on for something alright!

Then I'm screamin' in my head when I've got nowhere to go
Then I'm fallin' your bed, on a high can it go low
And I know I'm bound to lose
When I feel the need to use
Why I'm full
Why I'm full
