It's Only Right



New ways to spend all my time
Some's gone and some doesn't feel right
I need a new place to stay
And I don't think I'm gonna find it
You say you want, but never will
Just take it back and tell me no
It's easier to be alone
Than to be lied to

Why'd you waste all the time?
Back and forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell me now
Was it worth all the doubt?
You're not here with me, dear
Can we go through the years?
Take you there every night
Say that it's only right

White noise that plays in my head
Try to recall the words you said
Can you slip into my dreams?
And then I'll never wanna wake up
I hear you talk when you're not there
It comes at me from everywhere
Oh, can you lose the rest of me
And take my mind away?

Why'd you waste all the time
Back and forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell me now
Was it worth all the doubt?
You're not here, with me dear
Can we go, through the years?
Take you there, every night
Say that it's only right

I'm wide awake, it feels like all the time
I need to know if it'll be alright
I'm waiting on another day to fall
When you're awake to hear my call
'Cause it's open
I'm wide awake, it feels like all the time (My door is open)
I need to know if it'll be alright
(Please let me know when)
I'm waiting on another day to fall (You're coming home)
When you're awake to hear my call

Why'd you waste all the time
Back and forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell me now
Was it worth all the doubt?
You're not here, with me dear
Can we go, through the years?
Take you there, every night
Say that it's only right
