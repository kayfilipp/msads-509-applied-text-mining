Wish that things could be simple as they used to be
Want to take you for a ride
You'll lay back the seat
There won't be a need to be formal

Think your patience is wearing off
If you go, you'll know I'll be lost
Have a marvelous time, I won't get you off of my mind

When you look at me, is there something left to the (Hmm)
