Missing Out



We'll ignore but we cannot deny
We say a lot without speaking our minds
When we try, we end up running circles
Then collide and just keep it internal

Will it go bad because I'm waiting till tomorrow?
Will it go bad because I'm wasting all your time?

I've been missing out on a beautiful life
We've been setting up just to burn it down
Something's different now
We've been changing
I'll be better off one of these days, you'll see

And I write all of it down just to see
Then delete it all again, hard to breathe

Will it go bad because I'm waiting till tomorrow?
Will it go bad because I couldn't hear you say

You'll be missing out on a beautiful life
Guess we set it up just to burn it down
Something's different now
We've been changing
We'll be better off one of these days, you'll see

(I'll be thinking of you)
(I'll be thinking of you)
(I'll be thinking of you)
(I'll be thinking of you)
(I'll be thinking of you)
(I'll be thinking of you)

Maybe that's alright
Maybe that's okay
It just hurts 'cause I
I can hear you say
Maybe that's alright
Maybe that's okay
It just hurts 'cause I
I can hear you say
We'll be missing out
I can hear you say
We'll be missing out
I can hear you say
We'll be missing out
Maybe that's okay
We'll be missing out (Maybe that's alright)
Maybe that's okay
