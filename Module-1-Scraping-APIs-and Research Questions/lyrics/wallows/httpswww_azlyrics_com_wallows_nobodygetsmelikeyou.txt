Nobody Gets Me (Like You)



I need a girl like you
Someone to pull me through
All the things that made sense
Suddenly feel different

I'm not that simple
Neither are you
I'm not that simple
Come see me through

So many people and people, and people, and people, and people
And nobody gets me like you
So just keep pulling me, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me
Keep pulling me closer to you
'Cause nobody gets me like you

We only just met tonight
But I think we'll put up a good fight
We're not that simple
Let's see it through

So many people and people, and people, and people, and people
And nobody gets me like you
So just keep pulling me, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me
Keep pulling me closer to you
'Cause nobody gets me like you

I've seen so many places (I've seen so many places)
I couldn't tell the difference (I couldn't tell the difference)
I need a girl like you (I need a girl like you)
You're the only difference

So many people and people, and people, and people, and people
And nobody gets me like you
So just keep pulling me, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me, pulling me
Keep pulling me closer to you

Keep pulling me closer to you
'Cause nobody gets me like you
'Cause nobody gets me like you
