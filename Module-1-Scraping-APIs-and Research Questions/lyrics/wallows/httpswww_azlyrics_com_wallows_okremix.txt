OK (Remix)



(Okay)

I know you so well, you know that I can tell (yeah)
The slightest difference in your facial expression (woop)
Don't tell me nothing's on your mind
If we're honest, it will all be fine (woop)

I'm someone who likes to talk things through (yeah)
The hardest thing is getting it out of you (okay)
I should sit back and give you a break
Let you close your perfect eyes (yeah)

'Cause there's no need to explain, I know what you wanna say
We could just say goodnight if you think that's alright
There's no need to explain, I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
There's no need to explain, I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Okay)

I'm getting too close, you say you love me most
It's hard to trust it even though I want to
Need to get this shit out of my head
Before I flip this on myself instead

I got a feeling, I got a feeling you don't want me
These tapes are reeling, when I'm alone, these tapes are haunted
So I say okay, okay, and learn to look the other way
I gotta respect, yeah, I gotta respect [?]

'Cause the consequences are dire
I can't help the fact that I'm lying
When I say that I love myself
More than you or anybody else

There's no need to explain, I know what you wanna say
We could just say goodnight if you think that's alright
There's no need to explain, I know that we can relate
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Okay)

There's no need to explain, I know what you wanna say (okay)
We could just say goodnight if you think that's alright (okay)
There's no need to explain, I know that we can relate (okay)
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Okay)
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Okay)
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Okay)
Can we get up and try to feel okay again?
Can we get up and try to feel okay again? (Okay)
