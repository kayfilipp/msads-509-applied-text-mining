On Time



Oh my love, I can't explain away my grief
Three words, they don't mean anything to me
Each time I try to play the game
I wind up in defeat
I know it's wrong, but she's right

Right on time
She's right on time
She's right on time

Oh my love, I don't know why we have to fight
I'd save your words 'cause we won't find the light
I hear you callin' out my name
It floats right over me
I'm almost gone but she's right

Right on time
She's right on time
She's right on time

I can't help it if I don't care
Help it if I don't care
Help it if I don't care
Baby, I can't help it if I don't care
Help it if I don't care
Help it if I don't care

She's right on time
She's right on time
She's right on time
Yeah, she's right on time (I can't help it if I don't care)
She's right on time (Help it if I don't care)
She's right on time (Help it if I don't care)
She's right on time (Help it if I don't care)
