Pictures Of Girls



I see the end
You wait for nothing
You and I we grew up in the suburbs
Now you're gone the city's done a number
It is not the same without you around
Oh

I see you there
Still shy but smiling
Now I find it hard to remember
All the times I've tried to forget her
I am hanging onto something real
'Cause pictures of girls are not for me
You see

You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)

You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood (I'd like to see it all)
(You should be down in Hollywood)
You should be down in Hollywood (I'd like to see it all)
(You should be down in Hollywood)
