Pulling Leaves Off Trees



I regret it if I let you see me alone
The guy you meet tomorrow, will he know where you're from?
And no what good would it do, would it do if I wait
Trying to belittle my political views
I fucking hate depression so I don't watch the news
The more aware that I am
The more I won't wanna say
The closer I get, I don't wanna see
Hearing footsteps coming after me
Pick up the pace, but I don't know where to go
Give it time you're pulling me around
Got me nervous, fall and hit the ground
Seasons changing, but then again so am I

Woah, light in the morning
Woah, who you gonna call?
Woah, new conditions for me
Maybe not a problem, and maybe not at all
Woah, I wanna hear ya
Woah, when you're on the stage
Woah, isn't that what I want to see, to be?
Oh

Can I make my own opinion tell me all about it
Everyone approves of it I wanna scream and shout it
And they don't wanna see us, I think it could be a sign
Adolescence forming at the line
They move way to quick to give it time
They're all the same, but how much is really mine

Woah, light in the morning
Woah, who you gonna call?
Woah, new conditions for me
Maybe not a problem, and maybe not at all
Woah, I wanna hear ya
Woah, when you're on the stage
Woah, isn't that what I want to see, to be?
Oh

If you want it, I can take it
Make it a little better
I will be here when the weather changes
You'll be waiting for the letter
I won't run away this time
I've got too much to lose
I will be here when it goes on (and on)

Woah, light in the morning
Woah, who you gonna call?
Woah, new conditions for me
Maybe not a problem, and maybe not at all
Woah, I wanna hear ya
Woah, when you're on the stage
Woah, isn't that what I want to see, to be
To breathe, or not to breathe?
Oh
