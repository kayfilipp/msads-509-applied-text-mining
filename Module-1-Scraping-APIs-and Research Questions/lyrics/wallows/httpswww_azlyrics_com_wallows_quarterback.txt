Quarterback



I'm anxious
Pacin'
Thoughts are
Racin'

Is this
Over
Why won't you call my number?

You said I'll be alright
I knew by the look in your eyes
But anytime you want you know I'll be the one
Do you feel the same or was it just for fun? 'Cause

Summer's gone
I'm alone wishing for your call
Starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over for the night
Quarterback's fine

Summer's gone
I'm alone wishing for your call
Starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over for the night
Quarterback's fine

Spotlights
Burned out
I'm left
With my doubts

Yeah, we're done
But what for?
I don't play for a team sport

You said I'll be alright
I knew by the look in your eyes
But anytime you want you know I'll be the one
Racing to your door even against the odds, but now

Summer's gone
I'm alone wishing for your call
Starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over for the night
Quarterback's fine

Summer's gone
I'm alone wishing for your call
Starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over for the night
Quarterback's fine
