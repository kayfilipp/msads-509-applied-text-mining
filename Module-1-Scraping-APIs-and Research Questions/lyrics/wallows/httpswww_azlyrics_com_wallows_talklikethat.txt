Talk Like That



Cut my heart in half, give it back when you talk like that
Probably all in all, if they call, get a heart attack
Feels more like your death, lost my breath, can you give me more?
Do it all again, by the end, tell me I'll be yours

Imply one thing and I'll think about it for days (Days)
What's my reaction without giving it away?
Lock me out when I hear it in your voice
Looking back as if I ever had a choice

I'm just nervous so I'm thinkin' way too long (Long)
'Cause they say it's 'cause I can't take it, then they're wrong
'Cause they don't understand me, man
You need the right man (I am the right man)
You need the right man (I am the right man)
You need the right man

Just wait 'til we're together, loves
I'll tell you everything I'm thinking of

Hey John, that last one was pretty good but, uh
How do you change the station on this thing?
