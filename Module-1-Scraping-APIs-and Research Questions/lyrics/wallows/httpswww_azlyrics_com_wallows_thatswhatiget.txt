That's What I Get



Honestly, part of me gives into temptation
Is it real?
I can't say
Need an affirmation

I don't know if I should stay this long
Tell me all the things that I've done wrong
Honestly what we need is communication

Girl, if you don't want it now, then you should spell it out

Heart on my sleeve
I just can't believe that I wasn't doing enough
I'd never give up on you but you gave up on me
And that's what I get for falling in love

Sick of this
It happens every time
Drink too much and say, "You need a ride?"
I don't know if I should stay this long
Maybe I should just be moving on

Girl, you don't want it now
I can spell it out

Heart on my sleeve
I just can't believe that I wasn't doing enough
I'd never give up on you but you gave up on me
And that's what I get for falling in love

Hard to believe you couldn't see that you and me could be enough
I give up on you 'cause you gave up on me
And that's what I get for falling in love
That's what I get for falling in love
(Now I know, now I know, ooo)
That's what I get for falling in love
