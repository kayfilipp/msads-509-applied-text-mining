These Days



Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way or mine

Spend every second with him
You're taking what you're giving
Your mother don't approve
Of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it
You shouldn't let him do it
And if there is a voice in your head
Don't listen to it

My mind is open wide, I think of it a thousand times
That empty space left in my bed from when you stayed the night
We were fucked up but you still made sure I slept on my side
I still wake up, wishing you're there when I opened my eyes

Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way or mine

Spend every second with him
You're taking what you're giving
Your mother don't approve
Of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it (My mind is open wide)
You shouldn't let him do it (I think of it a thousand times)
And if there is a voice in your head (That empty space left in my head)
Don't listen to it

Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way

Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way

Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way or mine
