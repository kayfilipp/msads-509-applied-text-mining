Trust Fall



You know this godawful song
You're singing to me
I like to have you around
You see right through me

Loud noise, close your eyes
Black hole, horrified, yeah time isn't the same
Dreams comforting shame

We don't want to choose
What we have to lose
Trust fall off of the bed
Then I busted my head

With our backs on the ground
You right beside me
I sing the godawful song
And you laugh at me
Why'd we run away
Pretend to be chased
I don't want this to change
Don't shake me away

I know what you want
Destined to stay on
Trust fall off of the bed
And I busted my head

Is this only a piece of what you wanted?
Can we finish the feeling that we started?
(You know this godawful song)
Is this only a piece of what you wanted? (You're singing to me)
(I like to have you around)
Can we finish the feeling that we started? (You see right through me)
Is this only a piece of what you wanted?
We know what we want
Can we finish the feeling that we started?
Destined to stay on
Is this only a piece of what you wanted?
Can I fall alseep
