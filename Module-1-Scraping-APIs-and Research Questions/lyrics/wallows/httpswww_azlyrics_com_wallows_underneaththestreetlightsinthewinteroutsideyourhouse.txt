Underneath The Streetlights In The Winter Outside Your House



You said you, you don't want me
And I said I, don't mind at all
I just want you to go
'Cause I don't need to know

If it looks like it'll work out for me
I, I will be on my way
I don't want to go
If you are gonna stay

I'm standing outside of your house
It's pretty dark out
Good thing there's lights
It's pretty cold though
I just need you right here
To warm me under the sky

If it looks like it'll work out for me
I, I will be on my way
I don't want to go
If you are going to stay
