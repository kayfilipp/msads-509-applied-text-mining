Worlds Apart



Am I afraid of you?
Do I pretend I don't care?
Just like the stars can tell all the worlds apart
I'll be here in the dark

Sit inside to watch the rain again
I watched all of my movies from the end to the start
I can't help but think about you now when the trailers start
'Cause I know we're worlds apart

Now I stand here unknown
A voice in the hall
You're famous for something
It's hard to recall

Will anything change?
It's stuck on a play
Our room is now vacant
The beds are well made

Do I exist in your heart?
Or did the ship sail away?
While I was in the gift shop
You swam with the sharks
And I know we're worlds apart

Now I stand here unknown
A voice in the hall
You're famous for something
It's hard to recall

We don't have a choice
The curtains have closed
I'm making a point
But you'll never know
Know, know, know
