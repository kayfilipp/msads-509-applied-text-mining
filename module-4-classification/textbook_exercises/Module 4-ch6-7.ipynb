      "text         Improve default format template Cay Horstmann has pointed out that current default format template is far from optimal. It would probably be more useful to include super.toString() instead of class name. This way the Object implementation of toString() inserts a full class name (also with a useless hash; but thats not a big problem) and each subclass can add their fields at the end. Heres a proposition for the template:; ; ${object.superToString} ; ; Would that modification be suitable for 3.5.1?; ; http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cayhorstmann/archive/2009/06/upgrading_to_ec.html\n",
